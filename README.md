A game made using the RPG Maker MV Engine. Currently in Development.

## Summary

In a medieval world, our story centres around two twins are separated at birth. One lives in the cold Canadian wilderness,
alone except for tribes which do not welcome outsiders. He grows up battling starvation, animals, and insanity within that
isolated environment. The other twin is brought up in warmth and comfort, with loving parents and opportunities abundant. 
Yet she must carry the heavy burden of aristocracy, soon lifted from a presumption of innocence to be the leader of a nation
that she finds morally repulsive.
